## About Me

Driven by curiosity and a desire to build tools that make a difference.  
After years in tech support, I’ve transitioned into software development and AI engineering—focusing on clean code, user-centered design, and powerful backend logic.

I enjoy turning complex challenges into simple, elegant solutions. Whether it's designing a sleek front-end interface or integrating intelligent features powered by AI, I aim to ship projects that are fast, functional, and built to last.
